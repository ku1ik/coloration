# Coloration

## About

__Coloration__ is editor/IDE color scheme converter. Right now it allows you to
 convert your favourite TextMate color scheme (in XML plist format) to Vim,
 JEdit and KDevelop/Kate/Kwrite color scheme. It tries to do its best to
 generate the most accurate result for given target.

## Requirements

If you are running Coloration from the command line locally, a modern version
 (> 2.0) of Ruby is required. Note: You may have trouble running Coloration with
 Windows installations. (Pull requests welcome!)

## Installation && Usage

You can use Coloration in two ways: online or on your local machine. The online
 version is available at [coloration.ku1ik.com](http://coloration.ku1ik.com/).
 If you like to install coloration on your own machine to do some batch
 conversion or for some other reason just run:

    gem install coloration

It gives you _tm2vim_, _tm2jedit_ and _tm2katepart_ binaries to do the
 conversion on command line.

## Contact

If you found a bug or want to look at the source code you should go to
 [github](http://github.com/sickill/coloration). Also if you tried to convert a
 theme and coloration failed or result is not quite good, please report an issue
 at [issue tracker](http://github.com/sickill/coloration/issues).
